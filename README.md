# An MCP Server-client Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end MCP server-client pipeline.

## MCP Server

An MCP server typically consists of:

- Tools -> Client calls code on the server
- Resources -> Set of data accessible to the mcp server
- Prompts -> Precreated query
- Samplings -> standardized way for server to query a client based on the prompt sent down to the AI.
